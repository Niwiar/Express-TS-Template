# Express.js TypeScript Server Starter Template with Suggestion Library

This is a starter template for creating an Express.js server using TypeScript. It also includes a suggestion library to provide intelligent suggestions to users.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- TypeScript: [https://www.typescriptlang.org/](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install dependencies:
3. Build the project:
4. Start the server:

## API Routes

The server includes a set of sample API routes for demonstration purposes. You can find them in the `src/routes` directory. Feel free to modify or extend these routes to fit your application's requirements.

## Recommended Libraries

1. **Prisma**: A modern database toolkit for TypeScript and Node.js that replaces traditional ORMs. It provides an intuitive way to interact with databases, generates type-safe and efficient queries, and offers features like data modeling, migrations, and real-time data synchronization.

2. **jsonwebtoken**: A library for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in your server. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications.

3. **bcrypt**: A library for hashing passwords securely. It provides an easy way to hash passwords before storing them in a database, making it more difficult for attackers to access user credentials.

4. **Zod**: A TypeScript-first schema validation library with a focus on developer experience. It allows you to define schemas and validate data against those schemas, ensuring that incoming data meets your application's requirements.

5. **Morgan**: A logging middleware for Express.js. It provides a simple way to log HTTP requests and responses, making it easier to debug and monitor your server.

6. **Helmet**: A security middleware that helps secure your Express.js server by setting various HTTP headers. It provides protection against common security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

7. **winston**: A versatile logging library for Node.js. It provides a simple and extensible API for logging messages at various levels of severity.

8. **socket.io**: A library for enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and clients. It allows you to build applications that require instant updates, such as chat applications and real-time dashboards.

9. **dotenv**: A library for loading environment variables from a `.env` file. It simplifies the process of managing configuration values for your server.

10. **axios**: A popular HTTP client library for making HTTP requests from the server. It supports features like request/response interceptors, automatic serialization/deserialization, and error handling.


Please refer to the documentation of each library for more information on how to use them in your server.
